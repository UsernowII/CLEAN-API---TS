# **Clean Node API**

## [**Link complete course**](https://www.udemy.com/course/tdd-com-mango/?referralCode=B53CE5CA2B9AFA5A6FA1)

This api is a portion of Professor Rodrigo Manguinho's (Mango) course on Udemy.

The objective of the training is to show how to create an API with a well-defined and decoupled architecture, using TDD (test-oriented programming) as a work methodology, Clean Architecture to distribute responsibilities in layers, always following the principles of SOLID and, whenever possible, applying Design Patterns to solve some common problems.
